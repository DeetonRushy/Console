# Interop

This section is dedicated to
functionality that provides
ways for other processes to use
`Console`.

# Method `#1`

Call the process with the flag
`--attach`. 

### Goals
Create a way for the parent process
(whoever is hosting) to connect
with `Console` via localhost.

A simple local connection to send
commands to.
